## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker].

## How to set up your development environment

Nothing special is needed to develop. I personally use nix and direnv as a
convenience to avoid installing the dependencies globally.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
